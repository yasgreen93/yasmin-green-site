      I was at The Economist for 2 years using a number of new technologies, including ReactJS, NodeJS, GraphQL,
      Relay, Redux, Jest, Mocha, Chai and Enzyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time at The Economist I worked in cross-functional and Agile teams covering the development of
      The
      Economist’s new website. This included integrating and testing new features. One of the main projects I
      have
      been a part of involved iterating on customer feedback and data analytics to improve the subscriber’s
      experiences when they visit

      designers, data analysts and other developers further down in the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also worked on another project which involves integrating The Economist articles into Google AMP using
      server
      side rendering with ReactJS, AMP templates and NodeJS for a very fast and seamless experience for our
      users.
